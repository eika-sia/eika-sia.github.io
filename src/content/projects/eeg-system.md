# Open-Source Low-Cost EEG System

This independent project aims to democratize neuroscience research by creating an accessible, research-grade EEG (electroencephalography) system. Traditional EEG systems cost tens of thousands of dollars, putting them out of reach for many researchers, students, and institutions.

## Project Vision

### Accessibility Goals

-   **Sub-$1000 total cost** compared to $20,000+ commercial systems
-   **Open-source design** enabling community contributions
-   **3D-printable components** for easy reproduction
-   **Research-grade quality** suitable for academic publications

### Educational Impact

Making neuroscience accessible to:

-   Universities with limited budgets
-   High schools teaching advanced biology
-   Maker communities interested in brain-computer interfaces
-   Developing countries building research capacity

## Hardware Architecture
