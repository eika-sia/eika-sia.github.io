# FPGA as an External Linux Computer

This independent hardware project explores the fascinating possibility of running a full Linux operating system on an FPGA board. Using the ULX3S FPGA development board, I'm implementing a soft-core processor capable of running a lightweight Linux distribution.

## Project Motivation

FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) offer unique advantages for embedded computing:

-   **Reconfigurable hardware** that can be optimized for specific tasks
-   **Parallel processing capabilities** not available in traditional processors
-   **Low-level hardware control** for real-time applications
-   **Educational value** in understanding computer architecture

## Technical Architecture

### ULX3S FPGA Board

The ULX3S is an open-source FPGA board featuring:

-   Lattice ECP5 FPGA with 85K LUTs
-   32MB SDRAM for system memory
-   MicroSD card slot for storage
-   WiFi capability via ESP32 module

### Soft-Core Processor Implementation

I'm implementing a RISC-V soft-core processor that provides:

-   **32-bit architecture** compatible with standard Linux distributions
-   **Memory management unit (MMU)** for virtual memory support
-   **Interrupt handling** for peripheral device integration
-   **Bus interface** for connecting external devices

## Linux Integration

### Lightweight Distribution

Running a minimal Linux kernel optimized for:

-   Small memory footprint (working within 32MB RAM)
-   Essential system services only
-   Custom device drivers for FPGA-specific peripherals
-   Network connectivity via WiFi

### Boot Process

The system boots through a carefully orchestrated sequence:

1. FPGA configuration loads the soft-core processor
2. Bootloader initializes memory and peripherals
3. Linux kernel loads from MicroSD card
4. Userspace applications start

## External Device Integration

### ESP32 Communication

The integrated ESP32 module provides:

-   **WiFi connectivity** for network access
-   **Bluetooth capabilities** for device pairing
-   **Additional GPIO** for sensor interfaces
-   **Real-time clock** functionality

### 7-Segment Display Interface

Custom FPGA logic drives multiple 7-segment displays for:

-   System status indication
-   Real-time data visualization
-   Debugging output
-   User interface elements

## Development Challenges

### Memory Constraints

Working within 32MB of RAM requires:

-   Careful kernel configuration to minimize memory usage
-   Efficient userspace applications
-   Smart memory management strategies

### Timing Closure

Ensuring the FPGA design meets timing requirements:

-   Clock domain crossing management
-   Pipeline optimization
-   Resource utilization balancing

### Device Driver Development

Creating custom Linux drivers for:

-   FPGA-specific peripherals
-   7-segment display controllers
-   Inter-processor communication with ESP32

## Applications and Future Work

This system serves as a platform for:

-   **Embedded systems education** - Understanding how computers work from hardware to software
-   **IoT development** - Creating connected devices with custom hardware acceleration
-   **Research projects** - Prototyping novel computer architectures
-   **Hobbyist computing** - Building custom computing solutions

## Current Status
