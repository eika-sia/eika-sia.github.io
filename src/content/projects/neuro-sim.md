# Impact of Dendritic Structures on Neural Processing

This research project explores how the intricate branching patterns of neuronal dendrites contribute to complex cognitive functions. Through collaboration between the University of Zagreb and Columbia University, we're investigating the computational capabilities that emerge from dendritic morphology.

## Research Objectives

### Dendritic Integration Analysis

Understanding how dendrites perform local computations through:

-   **Spatial integration**: How signals from different synaptic locations combine
-   **Temporal dynamics**: Time-dependent signal processing in dendritic trees
-   **Nonlinear transformations**: How dendritic geometry enables complex computations

### Biophysical Parameter Mapping

Quantifying the relationship between:

-   Dendritic branch geometry and electrical properties
-   Local ion channel distributions and signal propagation
-   Morphological diversity and functional specialization

## Methodological Approach

### Computational Modeling

-   **Multi-compartment models**: Detailed biophysical simulations of dendritic trees
-   **Parameter sensitivity analysis**: Identifying critical morphological features
-   **Machine learning integration**: Pattern recognition in structure-function relationships

### Experimental Validation

Collaborating with experimental neuroscientists to:

-   Validate computational predictions with electrophysiological data
-   Correlate morphological measurements with functional recordings
-   Test hypotheses about dendritic computation in living tissue

## Implications for Cognitive Function

This research has profound implications for understanding:

### Single-Neuron Computation

How individual neurons can perform complex operations previously thought to require neural networks.

### Information Processing Efficiency

Why evolution has produced such diverse dendritic morphologies and what computational advantages they provide.

### Neurological Disorders

How alterations in dendritic structure contribute to cognitive impairments in various neurological conditions.
