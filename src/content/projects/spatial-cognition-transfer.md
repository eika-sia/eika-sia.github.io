# Understanding Spatial Cognition and Information Transfer Among Humans

This long-term independent research project explores the fundamental mechanisms of spatial cognition in the human brain and investigates the theoretical possibilities of direct neural information transfer between individuals.

## Research Background

### Spatial Cognition Fundamentals

Spatial cognition represents one of the most fundamental aspects of human intelligence:

-   **Navigation abilities** that allow us to move through complex environments
-   **Mental mapping** that creates internal representations of space
-   **Spatial memory** that stores and retrieves location-based information
-   **Perspective taking** that enables understanding of spatial relationships from different viewpoints

### Population-Level Neural Activity

Understanding how groups of neurons work together:

-   **Neural ensembles** that encode spatial information collectively
-   **Population vector decoding** to extract spatial information from neural signals
-   **Temporal dynamics** of spatial representation during movement and memory
-   **Cross-regional communication** between hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and parietal areas

## Experimental Approaches

### Neural Recording Methodologies

Investigating spatial cognition through multiple recording techniques:

**High-Density EEG**

-   Multi-electrode arrays to capture population-level activity
-   Spatial filtering techniques to isolate brain regions
